# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(first_name: "Victoria", last_name: "Roos-Walls", email: "rooswalls@gmail.com", age:26, goal: "To eat plant-based every day.")
# User.create(first_name: "Joseph", last_name: "Zarate", email: "soxeatfeet@gmail.com", age:27, goal: "Track my food every day")
